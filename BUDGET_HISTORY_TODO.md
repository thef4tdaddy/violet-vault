# Budget History Implementation - Remaining Tasks

## ‚úÖ Completed

1. **Core Infrastructure**
   - ‚úÖ Encrypted budget history system (`src/utils/budgetHistory.js`)
   - ‚úÖ Zustand middleware integration (`src/utils/budgetHistoryMiddleware.js`)
   - ‚úÖ React hook for easy component usage (`src/hooks/useBudgetHistory.js`)
   - ‚úÖ UI component for viewing/managing history (`src/components/history/BudgetHistoryViewer.jsx`)
   - ‚úÖ Budget store integration with middleware
   - ‚úÖ Authentication flow integration for auto-initialization

2. **Features Implemented**
   - ‚úÖ Git-like commit system with encrypted snapshots
   - ‚úÖ Automatic change tracking and diff generation
   - ‚úÖ Commit history viewing with filtering
   - ‚úÖ Manual rollback/restore functionality
   - ‚úÖ Export functionality for backup
   - ‚úÖ History statistics and analytics

## üîÑ In Progress

### Priority: High

3. **UI Integration**
   - [ ] Add history viewer to main navigation/settings
   - [ ] Add "View History" button to key components (EnvelopeGrid, BillManager, etc.)
   - [ ] Create per-object history views (individual envelope/transaction history)

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - [ ] Test the complete flow: login ‚Üí auto-init ‚Üí make changes ‚Üí view history ‚Üí restore
   - [ ] Test encryption/decryption with different passwords
   - [ ] Test commit performance with large datasets
   - [ ] Test middleware integration with existing store operations

### Priority: Medium

5. **Tamper Detection & Verification**
   - [ ] Implement hash chain verification in `budgetHistory.js`
   - [ ] Add integrity check UI component
   - [ ] Add warnings for broken/tampered history chains

6. **Enhanced UI Features**
   - [ ] Add diff visualization for better change viewing
   - [ ] Implement commit browsing with preview
   - [ ] Add commit search/filtering by change type
   - [ ] Add batch operations (delete old commits, etc.)

7. **Performance Optimizations**
   - [ ] Implement commit pagination for large histories
   - [ ] Add commit compression for storage efficiency
   - [ ] Optimize diff generation for large objects
   - [ ] Add background commit cleanup

### Priority: Low

8. **Advanced Features**
   - [ ] Branch/tag support for major milestones
   - [ ] Commit signing with device fingerprints
   - [ ] History import/merge from backup files
   - [ ] Advanced analytics (change patterns, usage stats)

9. **Documentation & Help**
   - [ ] Add help tooltips to history viewer
   - [ ] Create user guide for budget history features
   - [ ] Document security model and encryption approach
   - [ ] Add JSDoc documentation to all functions

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the full flow with a real user scenario
   - Verify auto-initialization works on login
   - Check that history commits are created on budget changes

2. **UI Polish**
   - Add the BudgetHistoryViewer to the main app
   - Style the components to match app theme
   - Add loading states and error handling

3. **Performance Check**
   - Test with larger datasets (1000+ transactions/envelopes)
   - Profile commit/restore operations
   - Optimize if needed

## üîí Security Considerations

- ‚úÖ All history data is encrypted with user's master password
- ‚úÖ Only commit metadata (timestamp, message, author) stored unencrypted
- ‚úÖ Device fingerprinting for tamper detection
- [ ] Hash chain verification for integrity
- [ ] Consider adding optional commit signing

## üìù Usage Example

```javascript
// In a component
const { actions, getHistory, restoreFromHistory } = useBudgetHistory();

// Use history-tracked actions
actions.addEnvelope(newEnvelope);
actions.updateTransaction(modifiedTransaction);

// View history
const history = await getHistory({ limit: 20 });

// Restore from history
await restoreFromHistory(commitHash);
```

## üéØ Success Criteria

- [ ] User can view complete encrypted edit history
- [ ] User can restore budget to any previous state
- [ ] History is automatically tracked on all budget changes
- [ ] Export/import works for backup/recovery
- [ ] Performance acceptable with 1000+ history entries
- [ ] All data remains encrypted and private
