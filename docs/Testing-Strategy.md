### 3. ‚ùå Test Suites with Issues

#### Hook Integration Tests (ES Module Issues)
- **`src/test/hooks/bills/useBillManager.test.js`**
  - ‚ùå ES module/CommonJS mixing issues
  - ‚ùå Mock implementation problems  
  - ‚ùå Environment variable issues in test context

#### Form Hook Tests
- **`src/test/hooks/bills/useBillForm.test.js`**
  - ‚ùå Similar ES module compatibility issues

#### Helper Integration Tests
- **Various integration test files**
  - ‚ùå Primarily ES module import resolution in test environment
  - ‚ùå Test environment configuration issues

## Known Issues and Solutions

### 1. ES Module/CommonJS Compatibility
**Issue**: Tests failing due to ES module import issues in test environment
**Status**: 53 tests affected
**Solution**: 
- All local imports now have `.js` extensions (recently fixed)
- Remaining issues are test-specific module loading problems

### 2. Test Environment Configuration  
**Issue**: `import.meta.env` not available in test context
**Status**: Affects logger and other environment-dependent modules
**Solution**: Mock environment variables in test setup

### 3. Mock Implementation Issues
**Issue**: Some tests using outdated mocking patterns
**Status**: Primarily affects hook integration tests
**Solution**: Update test patterns to use Vitest-compatible mocking

## Next Steps

### Priority 1: ES Module Compatibility
- Fix remaining 53 test failures related to ES module imports
- Update test environment configuration for `import.meta.env`
- Modernize mock patterns for Vitest compatibility

### Priority 2: Integration Test Improvement
- Resolve hook integration test issues
- Update mocking patterns for better test isolation
- Add missing test environment setup

### Priority 3: Security Test Expansion
- Add comprehensive encryption/decryption tests
- Implement authentication flow testing
- Add file upload security validation

## Notes

VioletVault's testing infrastructure is robust and comprehensive, with excellent coverage of core business logic and validation. The 85.6% pass rate represents a solid foundation, with remaining issues primarily related to test environment configuration rather than application logic defects.

The recent Issue #505 refactoring significantly improved test reliability and coverage, demonstrating the value of comprehensive testing during major architectural changes.
