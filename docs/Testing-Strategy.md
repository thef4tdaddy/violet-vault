# Testing Strategy for VioletVault

## Current State

VioletVault currently has **no test framework or tests** implemented. This document outlines the recommended testing strategy for our encrypted budgeting application.

## Recommended Test Framework Setup

### Core Testing Dependencies

```bash
# Unit and Component Testing
npm install --save-dev vitest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jsdom

# End-to-End Testing
npm install --save-dev playwright
```

### Test Configuration

Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test": "vitest",
    "test:watch": "vitest --watch",
    "test:coverage": "vitest --coverage",
    "test:e2e": "playwright test"
  }
}
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests (Priority: Critical)

#### Encryption & Security
- **`src/utils/encryption.js`**
  - AES-GCM encryption/decryption accuracy
  - PBKDF2 key derivation with 100,000 iterations

  - Device fingerprinting functionality

#### Budget Logic
- **Envelope calculations**
  - Allocation percentages and rounding
  - Budget vs actual spending comparisons
  - Paycheck distribution algorithms
- **Transaction processing**
  - Category matching and auto-categorization
  - Transaction splitting across envelopes
  - Balance calculations and reconciliation

#### Data Validation
- **Input sanitization**
  - Currency formatting and validation
  - Date parsing and validation
  - User input filtering for XSS prevention

### 2. Integration Tests (Priority: High)

#### Firebase Operations
- **`src/utils/firebaseSync.js`**
  - Cloud sync functionality
  - Conflict resolution during simultaneous edits
  - Offline/online state transitions
  - Data encryption before cloud storage

#### Local Storage
- **`src/db/index.js` and `src/db/optimizedDb.js`**
  - IndexedDB operations via Dexie
  - Data persistence and retrieval
  - Migration between schema versions
  - Storage quota management

#### Authentication Flow
- **`src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`**
  - Master password verification
  - Password change without data loss
  - Multi-device authentication
  - Session management and timeouts

### 3. Component Tests (Priority: Medium)

#### Core Components
- **Dashboard (`src/components/layout/Dashboard.jsx`)**
  - Data loading and error states
  - Real-time updates from sync
  - Performance with large datasets
  
- **Transaction Ledger (`src/components/transactions/TransactionLedger.jsx`)**
  - Virtual scrolling with large transaction lists
  - Filtering and search functionality
  - Pagination performance
  
- **Envelope Grid (`src/components/budgeting/EnvelopeGrid.jsx`)**
  - Budget allocation displays
  - Drag-and-drop interactions
  - Responsive layout behavior

#### Form Components
- **Transaction Form (`src/components/transactions/TransactionForm.jsx`)**
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Auto-complete functionality
  - Form submission and clearing

### 4. End-to-End Tests (Priority: Medium)

#### Critical User Flows
1. **New User Setup**
   - Account creation with master password
   - Initial budget envelope creation
   - First transaction entry
   
2. **Multi-Device Sync**
   - Changes on Device A appear on Device B
   - Conflict resolution when editing simultaneously
   - Offline changes sync when reconnected
   
3. **Password Security**
   - Master password change without data loss
   - Account lockout after failed attempts
   - Data remains encrypted during password change

#### Financial Workflows
1. **Complete Budget Cycle**
   - Paycheck processing and allocation
   - Bill payment and envelope deduction
   - Month-end reconciliation
   
2. **Import/Export**
   - CSV transaction import
   - Data export functionality
   - File format validation

## Security Testing Priorities

Given VioletVault handles sensitive financial data, security testing is **critical**:

### Encryption Verification
- Verify all sensitive data is encrypted before storage
- Test key derivation consistency across sessions
- Validate encryption strength and algorithm implementation

### Data Privacy
- Ensure no plaintext financial data in logs
- Verify Firebase data is encrypted client-side
- Test device fingerprinting doesn't leak sensitive info

### Input Security
- XSS prevention in all user inputs
- SQL injection prevention (though using NoSQL)
- File upload security for transaction imports

## Test Data Strategy

### Realistic Test Data
- Sample budgets with various envelope structures
- Transaction histories of different sizes (10, 100, 1000+ transactions)
- Multi-user scenarios with shared budgets
- Edge cases: negative balances, large amounts, special characters

### Performance Benchmarks
- Transaction ledger rendering with 10,000+ transactions
- Sync performance with large datasets
- Memory usage during extended sessions
- Battery impact on mobile devices

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Critical Security (Week 1)
- Encryption/decryption unit tests
- Authentication flow integration tests
- Basic component smoke tests

### Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 2)
- Budget calculation unit tests
- Transaction processing tests
- Local storage integration tests

### Phase 3: User Experience (Week 3)
- Component interaction tests
- Form validation tests
- Error boundary tests

### Phase 4: End-to-End (Week 4)
- Complete user workflow tests
- Multi-device sync scenarios
- Performance and security audits

## Continuous Integration

### Pre-commit Hooks
- Run unit tests before commits
- Lint and format code
- Check test coverage thresholds

### CI Pipeline
- Run full test suite on pull requests
- Performance regression testing
- Security vulnerability scanning

## Success Metrics

### Coverage Targets
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for utils and business logic
- **Integration Tests**: 80%+ coverage for data operations
- **Component Tests**: 70%+ coverage for UI components
- **E2E Tests**: 100% coverage of critical user paths

### Performance Benchmarks
- Transaction ledger renders <100ms for 1000 transactions
- Sync operations complete <2s for typical datasets
- App startup time <1s on typical devices

## Notes

This testing strategy prioritizes security and data integrity given VioletVault's role in managing personal financial information. The encryption and authentication systems should be thoroughly tested before implementing other test categories.
