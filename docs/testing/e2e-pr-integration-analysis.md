**Review Feedback Pending**: NONE - ALL COMPLETE ✅

All documentation, selector optimization, and edge case handling applied.

**Dependencies**: Unrelated dependencies added in original PR (framer-motion, html-to-image, react-joyride, happy-dom, @types/recharts) - these were NOT included in final merge (correct decision)

### PR #1935: Critical Path Smoke Tests ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Status**: INTEGRATED + AUTH BUG FIXED + PARTIAL REVIEW APPLIED
**Base**: feat/playwright-e2e-clean
**Test Coverage**: 3 smoke tests

1. App loads with demo mode & unique budget ID
2. Basic workflow (envelope → transaction → balance)
3. Data persistence (reload & verify)

**Auth Bug Fix**: RESOLVED ✅

- **Location**: `src/components/auth/UserSetup.tsx`
- **Solution**: Added E2E demo mode bypass that auto-completes auth setup
- **Impact**: Unblocks ALL E2E tests from running under automated Playwright conditions
- **How it works**: When `VITE_DEMO_MODE=true`, UserSetup automatically calls `onSetupComplete` with demo credentials, bypassing multi-step form

**Review Feedback Applied**: ✅ COMPLETE (13/13 comments)

- [x] Removed arbitrary waitForTimeout() calls from all 3 tests
- [x] Replaced with explicit expect().toBeVisible() waits with generous timeouts
- [x] Used networkidle waits after page navigation
- [x] Verified no page.reload() anti-patterns in smoke tests
- [x] Auth fixture uses separate authenticatedPage fixture correctly
- [x] Smoke tests verified as flexible and defensive in selector patterns
- [x] Converted all console.log to test.step() for structured logging
- [x] Added structured test reporting throughout all 3 smoke tests
- [x] Added comprehensive fixture design rationale explaining UI interaction approach
- [x] Added selector strategy documentation (role-based → data-testid → text patterns)
- [x] Added test isolation documentation ensuring parallel-safe test design
- [x] Documented test data independence and IndexedDB reset behavior
- [x] All selector optimization recommendations complete

### PR #1938: Bill Payment Workflow Tests ⚠️ PARTIALLY COMPLETE

**Status**: MERGED + REVIEW FEEDBACK IN PROGRESS
**Base**: feat/playwright-e2e-clean
**Test Coverage**: 5 bill payment scenarios

- Bill creation, payment, recurring bills, overdue indicators, payment history

**Code Integrated**: ✅

- Bill payment workflow test spec merged

**Architecture Migration**: ✅

- Updated `seedBills()` to create bills as scheduled expense transactions
- Bills now: `transactions` with `isScheduled: true`, `type: "expense"`
- Removed references to deprecated `db.bills` table
- Updated `clearAllTestData()` and `getBudgetState()`

**Review Feedback Applied**: ⚠️ PARTIAL (11/15 comments)

- [x] Removed unused variable `bills` from Tests 2-5 (seedBills calls retained for setup)
- [x] Removed arbitrary waitForTimeout() calls from navigation and after interactions
- [x] Replaced with networkidle waits for deterministic behavior
- [x] Verified seedBills() correctly uses envelope IDs from seedEnvelopes
- [x] Test artifacts already in .gitignore
- [x] Tests verified as readable and maintainable
- [x] Transaction structure verified as v2.0 compatible
- [x] Test 2 completed with envelope balance verification assertion
- [x] Test 3 completed with proper recurring bill frequency validation via DB
- [x] Test 5 completed with payment history record verification
- [x] Recurrence rule mapping added for quarterly/annual frequencies
- [x] Converted all console.log to test.step() for structured reporting

**Review Feedback Pending**: TODO (4 remaining)

- [ ] Bill category mapping as configurable constant
- [ ] Overdue indicator UI verification (Test 4 enhancement)
- [ ] Multiple payment records seeding for realistic history test
- [ ] Complete data structure documentation

### PR #1939: Paycheck Processing Workflow Tests ✅

**Status**: MERGED + REVIEW FEEDBACK APPLIED
**Base**: feat/playwright-e2e-clean
**Test Coverage**: 3 paycheck scenarios

1. Auto-allocation (proportional to envelope goals)
2. Manual allocation (specific distribution)
3. Auto-funding rules

**Code Integrated**: ✅

- `e2e/workflows/paycheck-processing.spec.ts` (459 lines)
- `e2e/workflows/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`
- Enhanced auth fixture with demo mode support
- `waitForBudgetDb()` helper function

**Auth Fixture Issue**: RESOLVED ✅

- Original issue: Onboarding screen doesn't progress
- Fix: Demo mode bypass handles auth automatically

**Review Feedback Applied**: ✅ COMPLETE (8/8 comments)

- [x] Type safety: explicitly import and type `Page` from '@playwright/test' for `waitForBudgetDb()` parameter
- [x] Replaced hard-coded waitForTimeout() calls with networkidle waits
- [x] Fixed auth fixture error handling - throws meaningful error if budgetId not found
- [x] Removed unused variable pattern consolidation
- [x] Test artifacts already in .gitignore
- [x] Force click fallback verified as necessary for button interactivity
- [x] Paycheck processing logic matches v2.0 architecture
- [x] Auto-allocation calculations verified through database assertions

### PR #1940: Envelope Transfer Workflow Tests ✅

**Status**: MERGED + REVIEW FEEDBACK APPLIED
**Base**: feat/playwright-e2e-clean
**Test Coverage**: 5 transfer scenarios

1. Simple transfer (balance atomic updates)
2. Insufficient funds (rejection validation)
3. Bulk allocation (distribute unallocated income)
4. Self-transfer prevention
5. Transfer history (bidirectional visibility)

**Technical**: Flexible selector strategies to handle UI variations

**Review Feedback Applied**: ✅ COMPLETE (10/10 comments)

- [x] Starting balance properly seeded as $500 transaction
- [x] Balance values parsed and validated with parseCurrency utility
- [x] Test 1: source envelope balance decreased by exactly $150 (toBeCloseTo assertion)
- [x] Test 1: destination envelope balance increased appropriately
- [x] Test 2: validation logic ensures transfer exceeding balance is disabled
- [x] Test 3: unallocated balance decreased by exactly $1600 (assertion present)
- [x] Test 3: envelope allocations verified ($1000, $400, $200)
- [x] Test 4: self-transfer prevention with expect(isDisabled).toBe(true) assertion
- [x] Test 5: source history transfer record visibility verified
- [x] Test 5: destination history correctly shows $75 transfer

## Critical Issues & Action Items

### AUTH BUG: RESOLVED ✅

**Priority**: CRITICAL
**Root Cause**: Multi-step UserSetup form was blocking E2E tests from completing authentication

**Solution Implemented**:

```typescript
// E2E Demo Mode Bypass: Skip multi-step auth for E2E tests
useEffect(() => {
  const isDemoMode = import.meta.env.VITE_DEMO_MODE === "true";
  if (isDemoMode && onSetupComplete) {
    logger.debug("🎭 E2E Demo Mode: Auto-completing user setup for testing");
    const demoSetup = {
      password: "test-password-123",
      userName: "Demo User",
      userColor: "#a855f7",
      shareCode: "",
    };
    onSetupComplete(demoSetup).catch((error) => {
      logger.error("E2E Demo Mode: Auto-setup failed", error);
    });
  }
}, [onSetupComplete]);
```

**Impact**:

- All smoke tests can now execute automatically
- All workflow tests (transaction, bill, paycheck, envelope) unblocked
- Tests run end-to-end without manual intervention

```

## Notes for Future Development

- **Auth Fixture**: Uses demo mode bypass - production auth still works normally

- **Isolation**: Tests use separate Firefox test project credentials (.env.test)
- **CI/CD**: E2E tests integrated into full_salvo.py with 30-minute debounce
- **Smoke Tests**: Run on every PR via CI workflow for fast feedback
- **Code Quality**: Review feedback from PRs can be applied incrementally in future refactoring passes
