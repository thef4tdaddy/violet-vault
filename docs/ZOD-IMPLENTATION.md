# Zod Integration Audit

This document provides an audit of the Zod schema integration across the Violet-Vault application.

## Implemented Features

The following features have been successfully implemented and are in use:

- **OpenAPI Schema Generation**: The project automatically generates OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation from Zod schemas.
- **Service-Level Validation**: The `budgetDatabaseService` validates all data entering and leaving the service against Zod schemas.
- **API Response Validation**: A comprehensive set of Zod schemas is in place to validate the structure of API responses.
- **Test Data Factories**: The project includes factories for generating test data that is compliant with the Zod schemas.
- **Form Validation (Partial)**: The validation logic for the Debt and Savings Goal forms has been migrated to Zod schemas.
- **Core Type Schemas**: Core authentication types (`UserData`, `AuthState`, etc.) have been defined and are validated with Zod.
- **Component Prop Validation (Partial)**: Runtime prop validation has been implemented for a subset of "priority" components (`EnvelopeGrid`, `TransactionTable`, `BillTable`, `MainDashboard`).
- **Standardized Hook-Level Validation (Partial)**: A reusable pattern for form validation within React hooks (`useValidatedForm`) has been created and implemented in `useBillFormValidated`.

## Areas for Improvement

The following areas represent incomplete or unimplemented parts of the Zod integration.

### 1. Standardized Hook-Level Validation

The new `useValidatedForm` pattern provides a consistent, type-safe way to handle form state and validation. However, it has only been applied to the bills form.

**Forms/Hooks to be Migrated:**

- **Debt Form:** The logic in `useDebtModalLogic` and related hooks should be refactored to use `useValidatedForm`.
- **Savings Goal Form:** The validation logic within `useSavingsGoalModal` or similar hooks should be migrated.
- **Income/Paycheck Forms:** Any hooks related to adding or editing income sources need to be updated.
- **Transaction Forms:** Hooks for manually adding or editing transactions should be migrated to the new pattern.
- **User Profile/Settings Forms:** Hooks managing user profile updates should adopt the standardized validation.

### 2. Component Prop Validation

Runtime prop validation helps catch bugs during development by ensuring components receive the correct data types. This is currently only active for a few priority components.

**High-Priority Components to Update:**

- `SavingsGoals`
- `PaycheckHistory`
- `EnvelopeItem`
- `TransactionRow`
- `BillItem`
- `AnalyticsDashboard`
- `CreateEnvelopeModal`
- `EditEnvelopeModal`
- `DebtSummary`
- `BudgetSummary`
- `Settings`

**UI & Form Components to Update:**

- `DatePicker`
- `Select`
- `InputField`
- Other custom form elements.

---
This audit provides a clear path forward for completing the Zod integration, which will improve the application's robustness, type safety, and developer experience.
