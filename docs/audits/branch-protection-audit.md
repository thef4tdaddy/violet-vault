# Branch Protection & Repository Rules Audit

**Date:** October 31, 2025  
**Current State:** Minimal protection, ready for improvement

---

## 📊 Current Configuration

### Repository Rulesets

**Ruleset 1: "main" (ID: 7136278)**
- **Status:** 🔴 DISABLED (as of Oct 31, 12:31pm)
- **Target:** main branch
- **Rules:**
  - ✅ Prevent deletion
  - ✅ Prevent force push (non-fast-forward)
  - ✅ Require linear history
  - ✅ Require status check: "check-commits"

**Ruleset 2: "Prevent Deletion" (ID: 6958603)**
- **Status:** ✅ ACTIVE
- **Target:** develop, style, lighthouse-reports, feat*/* branches
- **Rules:**
  - ✅ Prevent deletion only

### Branch Protection (Classic)
- **main:** ❌ NOT PROTECTED (no classic branch protection)
- **develop:** ❌ NOT PROTECTED (no classic branch protection)

---

## ⚠️ Issues Found

### Critical Issues

1. **Main branch ruleset is DISABLED**
   - No protection on main branch currently
   - Anyone can force push or delete (no rules active)
   - Status checks not enforced

2. **No branch protection on develop**
   - develop has no rulesets
   - Only protected from deletion via ruleset #2
   - No status check requirements

3. **Missing important protections**
   - No PR review requirements
   - No code owner requirements
   - No deployment environment protection

4. **Documentation is outdated**
   - Docs describe protections that don't exist
   - Lists workflows that may not exist
   - Last updated: August 5, 2025

## 🎯 Recommended Configuration

### For Main Branch

**Re-enable Ruleset #7136278 with enhancements:**

```json
{
  "name": "main",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",  ← ENABLE THIS
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": {
      "include": ["refs/heads/main"]
    }
  },
  "rules": [
    { "type": "deletion" },                    ← Keep
    { "type": "non_fast_forward" },            ← Keep
    { "type": "required_linear_history" },     ← Keep
    { 
      "type": "required_status_checks",        ← Keep but update
      "parameters": {
        "required_status_checks": [
          { "context": "check-commits" },      ← Keep
          { "context": "Test Suite" },         ← ADD (from test.yml workflow)
          { "context": "Track ESLint and TypeScript Issues" }  ← ADD (from code-quality-tracker.yml)
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "type": "pull_request",                  ← ADD NEW
      "parameters": {
        "required_approving_review_count": 0,  ← 0 for now, or 1 if you want reviews
        "dismiss_stale_reviews_on_push": false,
        "require_code_owner_review": false,
        "require_last_push_approval": false
      }
    }
  ],
  "bypass_actors": [
    {
      "actor_id": 5,  ← Repository owner/admin
      "actor_type": "RepositoryRole",
      "bypass_mode": "always"
    }
  ]
}
```

### For Develop Branch

**Create new ruleset:**

```json
{
  "name": "develop",
  "target": "branch",
  "enforcement": "active",
  "conditions": {
    "ref_name": {
      "include": ["refs/heads/develop"]
    }
  },
  "rules": [
    { "type": "deletion" },
    { "type": "non_fast_forward" },
    {
      "type": "required_status_checks",
      "parameters": {
        "required_status_checks": [
          { "context": "check-commits" },
          { "context": "Test Suite" }
        ]
      }
    }
  ],
  "bypass_actors": [
    {
      "actor_id": 5,
      "actor_type": "RepositoryRole",
      "bypass_mode": "always"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🚀 Simplified Recommendations

### Minimum Protection (Current + Small Improvements)

**Main branch:**
1. ✅ Re-enable ruleset #7136278
2. ✅ Keep existing rules
3. ✅ Add "Test Suite" status check
4. ✅ Allow admin bypass

**Develop branch:**
1. ✅ Keep deletion prevention (active)
2. ✅ Add "check-commits" status check (optional)
3. ✅ Allow admin bypass

### Standard Protection (Recommended)

**Main branch:**
1. ✅ All minimum protections
2. ✅ Require PR (no direct pushes)
3. ✅ Require CI to pass (Test Suite, Code Quality)
4. ✅ Block force push
5. ✅ Block deletion

**Develop branch:**
1. ✅ Prevent deletion
2. ✅ Prevent force push
3. ✅ Require "check-commits" status check
4. ✅ Allow direct pushes (for quick fixes)

### Maximum Protection (Enterprise-grade)

**Main branch:**
1. ✅ All standard protections
2. ✅ Require 1+ PR review
3. ✅ Require CODEOWNERS review
4. ✅ Dismiss stale reviews on push
5. ✅ Require conversation resolution
6. ✅ Lock branch (no direct commits)

**Develop branch:**
1. ✅ All standard protections
2. ✅ Require status checks to pass

## 📋 Current Workflows to Protect

These workflows exist and should be status check requirements:

**Critical:**
- ✅ `Test Suite` (test.yml) - Must pass
- ✅ `Track ESLint and TypeScript Issues` (code-quality-tracker.yml) - Should pass
- ✅ `check-commits` (enforce-commit-types.yml) - Must pass

**Important:**
- `npm Audit` (npm-audit.yml) - Security checks
- `Lighthouse Monitoring` (lighthouse-monitoring.yml) - Performance

**Optional:**
- `Bundle Size` (bundle-size.yml) - Size tracking
- `Preview Deployment` (preview-deployment.yml) - Vercel preview

---

## 🎯 My Recommendation for v2.0

### For Main Branch:

**Re-enable ruleset with these rules:**
- ✅ Prevent deletion
- ✅ Prevent force push
- ✅ Require linear history
- ✅ Require status checks:
  - `check-commits` (commit format)
  - `Test Suite` (tests must pass)
  - `Track ESLint and TypeScript Issues` (code quality)
- ✅ Admin can bypass (for emergencies)
- ❌ Don't require PR reviews yet (you're solo dev)

### For Develop Branch:

**Create new ruleset with these rules:**
- ✅ Prevent deletion
- ✅ Prevent force push
- ✅ Admin can bypass
- ❌ No status check requirements (allow quick fixes)

**Why minimal on develop:**
- You work solo, need flexibility
- Can fix things quickly without CI blocking
- Main branch is the real gate

## ✅ Action Items

### Immediate (Do Now):
1. **Re-enable "main" ruleset** (#7136278)
   - Go to: https://github.com/thef4tdaddy/violet-vault/rules/7136278

   - Click Save

3. **Update documentation**
   - Update `docs/setup/Branch-Protection-Rules.md` to match reality

### Optional (Nice to Have):
1. Create develop branch ruleset
2. Add PR review requirement to main (when you have team)
3. Add CODEOWNERS file
