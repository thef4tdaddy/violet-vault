This document contains solutions to common issues and troubleshooting steps for VioletVault.

## üîÑ Sync Issues

### Sync Not Working / Data Not Syncing

**Symptoms:**
- Data added on one device doesn't appear on another
- Manual sync button doesn't seem to work
- "Sync failed" messages

**Most Common Causes:**

#### 1. Network Environment Issues ‚≠ê **Most Common**
- **Corporate/Work WiFi** blocking cloud services
- **Poor mobile signal** causing timeouts
- **Public WiFi** with restrictions
- **VPN interference** (rare, but possible)

**Solution Steps:**
1. Try switching networks (WiFi ‚Üî Mobile data)
2. Test on a different network (home vs work)
3. Check if VPN affects sync (try with/without)
4. Use mobile browser developer tools to check for network errors

**Case Study:** See [Issue #516](https://github.com/thef4tdaddy/violet-vault/issues/516) for a detailed investigation of network-related sync issues.

#### 2. Browser/Device Specific Issues
- **Safari vs Chrome** - Try alternative browser
- **Private/Incognito mode** - May block IndexedDB
- **Storage quota exceeded** - Clear browser data
- **Outdated browser** - Update to latest version

**Solution:**
```javascript
// Check browser compatibility in console:
console.log('IndexedDB:', !!window.indexedDB);
console.log('Storage:', navigator.storage);
```

#### 3. Data Corruption Recovery
If sync fails consistently, try a **data reset**:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning:** This will clear local data. Make sure you have data in the cloud first.

1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Data Management
2. Export data (backup)
3. Clear all local data

5. Allow sync to download from cloud

## üîê Authentication Issues

### Cannot Login / Password Issues

**Symptoms:**
- "Invalid password" errors

- Stuck on login screen

**Solutions:**
1. **Clear browser cache** - Old encryption keys may be cached
2. **Try different browser** - Rule out browser-specific issues
3. **Check password carefully** - VioletVault uses strong encryption
4. **Reset if needed** - Use "Reset and Start Fresh" option

### Lost Access to Account

**Recovery Options:**
1. **Cloud Backup** - If you had cloud sync enabled, data is recoverable
2. **Local Backup Files** - Check Downloads folder for exported data
3. **Fresh Start** - Create new account (if no backup available)

## üì± Mobile Device Issues

### Mobile Safari Problems

**Common Issues:**
- Touch events not working properly

3. **Check mobile network** - Switch between WiFi and cellular
4. **Update iOS** - Ensure latest Safari version

### Performance Issues on Mobile

**Symptoms:**
- Slow loading
- App freezing
- Memory warnings

**Solutions:**
1. **Close other apps** - Free up memory
2. **Restart browser** - Clear temporary memory
3. **Check data size** - Large budgets may be slower on mobile

## üåê Network Troubleshooting

### Corporate/Work Network Issues

**If sync fails at work but works at home:**

1. **Network Restrictions** - IT may block Firebase/cloud services
2. **Firewall Rules** - Corporate firewall blocking requests
3. **Proxy Settings** - May interfere with encrypted connections

**Workarounds:**
- Use mobile data instead of work WiFi
- Ask IT to whitelist Firebase domains
- Use personal VPN (if company policy allows)

### Home Network Issues

**Router/ISP Problems:**
1. **DNS Issues** - Try different DNS (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1)
2. **Firewall Settings** - Check router firewall rules
3. **ISP Throttling** - Some ISPs throttle cloud services

## üîß Advanced Troubleshooting

### Using Browser Developer Tools

**To debug sync issues:**

1. **Open Developer Tools** (F12 or right-click ‚Üí Inspect)
2. **Go to Console tab**
3. **Look for error messages** during sync
4. **Check Network tab** for failed requests

**Useful Console Commands:**
```javascript
// Check sync status
runSyncHealthCheck()

// View recent sync activity  
getQuickSyncStatus()

// Run diagnostic tools
runDataDiagnostic()
```

### Mobile Debugging

**Safari on iOS:**
1. Connect iPhone to Mac via USB
2. Safari ‚Üí Develop ‚Üí [Your iPhone] ‚Üí Select tab
3. Full developer tools available

**Alternative - Built-in Logging:**
- VioletVault has extensive console logging
- Use Safari Web Inspector to view logs
- All sync operations are logged with details

## üÜò When to Report a Bug

**Report a bug if:**
- Issue persists across multiple networks
- Error occurs on multiple devices
- Data loss or corruption occurs
- Issue reproducible with specific steps

**Don't report if:**
- Issue only occurs on specific network
- Resolved by changing browsers
- Resolved by data reset/resync

**How to Report:**
1. Use the built-in bug reporter (preferred)
2. Include console logs from developer tools
3. Specify network environment (work, home, mobile)
4. Include device/browser information

## üìä Performance Guidelines

### Data Size Limits

**Recommended Limits:**
- **Envelopes:** < 100 for best performance
- **Transactions:** < 1000 active transactions
- **Bills:** < 50 active bills

**If you exceed these:**
- Use transaction archiving
- Archive old envelopes
- Performance may be slower on mobile

### Network Requirements

**Minimum Requirements:**
- **Upload:** 1 Mbps for sync
- **Latency:** < 500ms to Firebase
- **Reliability:** Stable connection for 30+ seconds
