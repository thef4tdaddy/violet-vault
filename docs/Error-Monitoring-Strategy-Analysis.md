# Error Monitoring Strategy Analysis: Highlight.io vs Sentry vs GlitchTip (2025)

## Current Setup Analysis

VioletVault currently uses **Highlight.io** with the following configuration:

### Current Implementation

- **Package**: `@highlight-run/react@19.0.23` and `highlight.run@9.18.23`
- **Environment separation**: Basic environment tagging (development, staging, production)
- **Privacy settings**: Input masking enabled, sensitive URLs blocked
- **Sampling rates**: 100% in dev, 10% session replay in production, 100% error sampling

### Issues with Current Setup

1. **Environment separation problems**: All environments currently use the same project ID
2. **Blocking issues**: Highlight.io often gets blocked by adblockers
3. **Integration limitations**: Missing Discord and GitHub integrations
4. **Free tier concerns**: May be approaching limits with 10k sessions/month

## Environment Separation Strategy

### Recommendation: Multi-Project Setup

For any chosen provider, implement proper environment separation:

1. **Production Project**: Main quota tracking
2. **Staging Project**: Separate project for testing
3. **Development**: Either separate project or disabled reporting

### Implementation Plan

```javascript
// Environment-aware configuration
const getErrorMonitoringConfig = () => {
  const env = import.meta.env.MODE;

  switch (env) {
    case "production":
      return {
        projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_ERROR_MONITORING_PROD_ID,
        sampleRate: 0.1,
        enableReporting: true,
      };
    case "staging":
      return {
        projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_ERROR_MONITORING_STAGING_ID,
        sampleRate: 1.0,
        enableReporting: true,
      };
    case "development":
      return {
        projectId: import.meta.env.VITE_ERROR_MONITORING_DEV_ID,
        sampleRate: 1.0,
        enableReporting: false, // Optional: disable dev reporting
      };
    default:
      return { enableReporting: false };
  }
};
```
