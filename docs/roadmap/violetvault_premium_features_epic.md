### 💎 Epic: Optional Premium Features & Monetization Plan
**Labels:** epic, premium, future, sustainability

This epic captures long-term ideas for optional premium features that could support VioletVault's ongoing development, infrastructure, and sustainability — without compromising its privacy-first, free-to-use philosophy.

These features are not required and will never interfere with core usage. Instead, they offer advanced tools, backup options, or supporter perks for those who wish to contribute.

### 🧠 Philosophy
- No ads, no tracking, no freemium lockouts
- Privacy-first, with encrypted local and cloud options
- Optional payments to offset infrastructure and dev time
- Core budgeting and security will always remain free
