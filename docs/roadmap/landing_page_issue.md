### 🟣 Convert Initial Page to Marketing Landing Page

**Labels:** frontend, marketing, UX, priority: high

Update the default entry point (`/`) of the VioletVault app to function as a public-facing landing page. This page should explain the product's value, build trust, and drive signups — not just show a login screen.

---

### 🧩 Goals:

- Replace login screen with public landing content
- Communicate VioletVault’s core benefits (privacy-first, encrypted, envelope-style)
- Link to login/signup and optionally demo

---

### ✅ Tasks:

- [ ] Create a `LandingPage.tsx` component for unauthenticated users
- [ ] Add headline and description text
- [ ] Add primary CTA: “Start Budgeting — It’s Free”
- [ ] Add secondary CTA: “Log In” (for returning users)
- [ ] Include 3–4 feature cards (Encryption, PWA support, No Ads, etc.)
- [ ] Add a screenshot or animated GIF preview
- [ ] Add GitHub, Privacy, and About links in footer
- [ ] Route `/` to landing page when unauthenticated
- [ ] Add "Try a Demo" button (optional sandbox mode)

---

### 🧭 Example Headline:

> **Private, Powerful Budgeting — On Your Terms**
> VioletVault is a local-first budgeting app that puts you in control. No tracking. No cloud lock-in. Just smart envelopes and encrypted data.

---

### 📈 Benefits:

- Improves onboarding and first impression
- Communicates values clearly before login
- Enables SEO and sharing even without an account
