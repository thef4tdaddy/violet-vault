# Changelog

## [2.0.0](https://github.com/thef4tdaddy/violet-vault/compare/violet-vault-v1.10.0...violet-vault-v2.0.0) (2025-11-29)

### 🎉 Major Release: TypeScript Conversion & Data Model Simplification

This is a major release with significant architectural improvements, type safety enhancements, and data model simplification.

### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

#### TypeScript Conversion
- **All code converted to TypeScript** - JavaScript files migrated to `.ts`/`.tsx`
- **Stricter type checking** - TypeScript strict mode enabled
- **Import paths standardized** - All imports must use `@` alias (e.g., `@/utils/foo`)
- **No `any` types** - All types must be properly defined

#### Data Model Simplification
- **Savings Goals → Envelopes** - Savings goals are now envelopes with `envelopeType: "savings"`
- **Supplemental Accounts → Envelopes** - Supplemental accounts are now envelopes with `envelopeType: "supplemental"`
- **Simplified relationships** - Two-entity system: Envelopes and Transactions
- **Single source of truth** - All money lives in envelopes

#### Auth Architecture
- **React Context for auth** - Auth state moved from Zustand to React Context
- **TanStack Query for auth operations** - Auth mutations/queries use TanStack Query
- **Zustand for UI only** - Zustand now only used for UI state (modals, forms)

#### Validation Changes
- **Zod schema validation** - All data validated with Zod schemas
- **Stricter validation** - Invalid data will be rejected
- **Runtime type checking** - Type safety at runtime
